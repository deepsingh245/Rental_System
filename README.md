# Rental_System
Welcome to Home Away! Our rental system is designed for college students and working professionals in India looking for a place to call home.

With Home Away, you can easily search for and rent houses that meet your needs. The system features separate dashboards for admin, owners, and rentees, making it easy for each group to manage their listings and rentals.

As an admin, you can manage all listings and transactions on the platform, ensuring that everything runs smoothly. Owners can list their properties and manage their rentals, while rentees can search for and book houses.

The system also includes a login/signup page, where users can create an account and log in to access their dashboard. Once logged in, users can also view their profile page, where they can update their personal information and view their rental history.

We hope you enjoy using Home Away, and if you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us.
